# Hi there!  

I'm Jak Buttarazzi, a software engineering student at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com), an accelerated full-stack development program. I'm passionate about using my creativity to solve problems and bring software to life.

In 2014, I graduated from the University of West Florida with a Bachelor's Degree in Film, and a minor in Art. I have an extensive background in freelance motion graphics and design, and I recently discovered a deep love for programming. I knew I wanted to pursue software engineering further, and I soon found Hack Reactor. It is routinely described as the best accelerated program out there for becoming a full-stack javascript developer.

If I'm not programming, you will likely find me trying my hands at carpentry or black & white photography, and when I have the opportunity, I enjoy hiking in the Appalachian mountains with my wolfdog Romulus.

You can view me at [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jakrazzi) or fork me on [github](http://github.com/jakrazzi).
