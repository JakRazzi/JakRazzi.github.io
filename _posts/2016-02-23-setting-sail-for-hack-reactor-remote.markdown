#Setting Sail for Hack Reactor Remote

In less than one week, I begin my Hack Reactor journey-- 11 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 3 months. I've already spent countless hours studying front-end web development, and when I complete the course, I will be a full-stack software engineer with over 800 hours of experience.  

###So how did I get here?  

A lot of studying, mostly. I come from no programming background whatsoever, but I recently discovered a passion for it. I used to always think that programming wasn't for me (despite my computer-savvy background), but when I actually started getting into it, I discovered that it was everything I love! I have the opportunity to think on my feet creatively about a problem and solve the puzzle-- all while working toward the greater goal of creating a program or website from nothing.  

When I first started learning to program, I knew it was what I wanted to go after. So I did some reasearch and decided to apply to the best accelerated school I could find-- Hack Reactor. I learned everything I could about it and read countless student blogs ([Richard Kho's](http://richardkho.com/choosing-hack-reactor/) was really helpful) that talked about how they got in. I learned that the acceptance rate for applicants is a crazy 3%, and after completing the application, I found out about the Technical Interview.  

I wasn't sure what to expect for that.  

So I studied. While working my full-time job, I put in over 100 hours of learning JavaScript in a three-week period to prepare for the interview. When it finally came time to test my abilities, I drank way too much coffee and met my interviewer on skype with caffeine and adrenaline in my veins. My interviewer was very nice, and after we talked a bit, we dove right in to programming. I left the interview feeling really good about it and recieved my acceptance letter the next day!  

###Here's how I prepared:  

If you're interested in Hack Reactor or you're getting ready for your own Technical Interview, then I'm sure you're wondering if you're ready. Some of the things I mention will be talked about in other places, but this is what I did to get ready:  

- First, I worked through [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) javascript course. It's really helpful, especially if you've never programmed before.  
- Then I started on [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (chapters 1-5). This is a fantastic resourse, but it gets really heavy after the third chapter. You are not going to understand it your first try. I kept coming back to chapter four and five until I really understood what was going on.  
- While I was going through Eloquent Javascript, I went to [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) and the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to learn about the methods an prototypes of Arrays, Objects, and Strings. You *have* to know these. These are the basics of JavaScript that you need to know, and most tutorials don't really teach them thoroughly enough. Make some flash cards and memorize all of them.  
- I knew I needed more help with higher-order functions, so I read more about them at [JavaScript is Sexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/) (they also have great articles on [Closures](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/) and [Scope](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/)). Higher-order functions are just something that you need to get a lot of practice with to really understand when you're new to it all. Make sure you know these well and are able to implement your own callback functions with ease.  
- I saw somewhere that CodeSchool had a coupon for their subscription service. I'm not sure how long it will last, so I won't link to it, but look around and you might find something. It was $9 for the first month. To be honest, I felt that CodeSchool was pretty hand-holdey, but the third JavaScript course was extremely helpful to me.  
- Finally, practice everything you learned with the [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/) challenges. I completed almost all of the easy ones before my interview.  

If you can do all of that AND understand it, then I would say you're ready to blow the interview out of the water.  

###What now?  

It's been a lot of fun so far, and soon I'll be so engrossed in this program that free time will be a pleasant memory of times gone by. If I have the opportunity, then I'll update this blog with my progress through the course, and I might even teach some of the things I'm learning here. Until then, the wind is at my back, and my sails are full.  

###One last thing...  

Don't worry about recursion too much. That's a rabbit hole I fell down that I still haven't quite climbed out of yet.
