# Have you ever wanted to explore the unknown?
Go somewhere that humankind has never touched before? Software engineering can bring you to the precipice of a digital frontier, unlike any other. Experienced engineers regularly encounter challenges that no one else has likely ever stumbled upon before.

This is part of the reason I so quickly fell in love with programming. I've always been an explorer, and engineering constantly brings me to new challenges and new discoveries. Every time I embark on a new project, I feel as though I'm lighting up a torch to peer into a great cavern filled with adventure.

When we encounter dead-ends on this journey, we have to find a new way to continue going. Solving these problems is as much an art as it is a science. At first our solutions will be crude - just blow up the obstacle to keep going - but these solutions inevitably lead to cave-ins down the line.

As our skills grow, however, we develop an intuition for finding new and beautiful solutions to these obstacles.

The challenge is sometimes easy, and we find ourselves racing down to the prize. Other times, we encounter traps and pitfalls constantly. 

What keeps us going is knowing that once we reach the end, we will have discovered and created a treasure that we can share with the world.
