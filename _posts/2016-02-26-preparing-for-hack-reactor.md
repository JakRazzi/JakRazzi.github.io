### Worried about your technical interview?
I was. Because of my circumstances, I wanted to make sure I was accepted after my first interview. I've heard that if you fail, they may ask you to wait between one and three months before applying again.  

I read countless student blogs ([Richard Kho's](http://richardkho.com/choosing-hack-reactor/) was really helpful), in addition to the emails and faq that Hack Reactor provides, in order to fully prepare for my interview, and I put in lots of study time. Also, I come from a background of zero programming experience, so I had a lot more ground to cover than some people.


### How I prepared:

Some of the things I mention will be talked about in other places, and I actually did more studying than what's listed here. However, I decided to leave off some of the information that I felt wasn't as necessary for my interview. Also, as a disclaimer, the technical interview may have changed since I took it, so don't use this as your only resource for studying.  

**Here we go:**

- First, I worked through [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/) JavaScript course. It's really helpful, especially if you've never programmed before.  

- Then I started on [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (chapters 1 - 5). This is a fantastic resource, but it gets really heavy after the third chapter. You are not going to understand it your first try. I kept coming back to chapter four and five until I really understood what was going on. Gordon Zhu has a very helpful [annotated version](http://watchandcode.com/courses/eloquent-javascript-the-annotated-version) for free that I used when I got really stuck (just don't look ahead at the answers). 

- While I was going through Eloquent Javascript, I also went to [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) and the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to learn about the methods an prototypes of Arrays, Objects, and Strings. **You have to know these.** These are the basics of JavaScript that you need to know, and most tutorials don't really teach them thoroughly enough. Make some flash cards and memorize all of them.  

- I knew I needed more help with higher-order functions, so I read more about them at [JavaScript is Sexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/) (they also have great articles on [Closures](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/), [Scope](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/), and other JavaScript fundamentals). Higher-order functions are just something that you need to get a lot of practice with to really understand when you're new to it all. Make sure you know these well and are able to implement your own callback functions with ease. **I cannot stress this enough, you have to know these**.

- I saw somewhere that CodeSchool had a coupon for their subscription service. I'm not sure how long it will last, so I won't link to it, but look around and you might find something. It was $9 for the first month. To be honest, I felt that CodeSchool was pretty hand-holdey, but the third JavaScript course was extremely helpful to me. If you're on a tight schedule, I wouldn't really bother with much else there.  

- Finally, practice everything you learned with the [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/) challenges. I completed almost all of the easy ones before my interview.  

If you can do all of that AND understand it, then I would say you're ready to blow the interview out of the water.  

### Oh, and one last thing...

Don't worry about recursion too much. That's a rabbit hole I fell down that I still haven't quite climbed out of yet.
