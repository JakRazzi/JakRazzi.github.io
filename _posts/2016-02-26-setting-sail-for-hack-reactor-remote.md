### In three days, I begin my Hack Reactor journey--  
11 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 3 months. I've already spent countless hours studying front-end web development, and when I complete the course, I will be a full-stack software engineer with over 800 hours of experience-- more than a typical CS Undergraduate.  

### Why did I choose Hack Reactor, and what is it?

[Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/) is considered by many to be the Harvard of software engineering bootcamps. It is a program that is designed to make you an in-demand software engineer that is ahead of the curve in today's job market. The accelerated program runs for 13 weeks and boasts a 99% graduate hiring rate as well as a $105k starting salary (and yes, those claims hold up after poking around).

I spent a lot of time and effort investigating Hack Reactor, and found out that it's the real deal. Lot's of programming bootcamps have gotten a bad reputation, but Hack Reactor has consistently remained above the crowd. This level of excellence can even be seen in their application process.

In order to apply, you have to solve a JavaScript coding challenge on their website. After sucessfully completing the challenge and submitting an application, you then have to pass a technical interview. During this interview, they test your knowledge of JavaScript and see if you're a good fit for the program. **Only 3% of applicants are actually accepted into the program.**

I knew that if I was serious about joining one of these programs, I wasn't going to waste my time with anything less than the best out there.

### So how did I get here?  

A lot of studying, mostly. I come from no programming background whatsoever, but I recently discovered a passion for it. I used to always think that programming wasn't for me (despite my computer-savvy background), but when I actually started getting into it, I discovered that it was everything I love!

I have the opportunity to think on my feet creatively about a problem and solve the puzzle-- all while working toward the greater goal of shaping a program or website from nothing.  

When I actually decided to give programming a try, I knew it was something I wanted to go after. So I did some reasearch and decided to apply Hack Reactor. I studied for the application challenge and was able to complete it after one or two tries. That's when I found out about the Technical Interview.  

**I wasn't sure what to expect for that.**  

So I studied. While working my full-time job, I put in over 100 hours of learning JavaScript in a three-week period to prepare for the interview. When it finally came time to test my abilities, I drank way too much coffee and met my interviewer on skype with caffeine and adrenaline in my veins.

My interviewer was really nice, and after we talked a bit, we dove right in to programming. I left the video call feeling pretty good about it and recieved my acceptance letter the next day!  

Since then, I gave my boss two week's notice (and actually stayed a bit longer to help train my replacement), and started on the precourse work that had to be finished before the program began. I completed everything last week and have been spending my remaining time getting ready and building this blog.

### What now?  

It's been a lot of fun so far, and soon I'll be so engrossed in the program that free time will be a pleasant memory of times gone by.

When I have the opportunity, I'll update this blog with my progress through the course, and I might even teach some of the things I'm learning here. Until then, the wind is at my back, and my sails are full.
